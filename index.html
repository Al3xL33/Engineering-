    <p>9/2/2022 - This week we learned about tinker cad and as our first assignment, we were told to make a kitchen appliance. I chose to make a blender. I think i did pretty well and i am excited for making the goldburg machine next week.</p>
    <p>9/9/22 - This week we designed our rube goldburg machines. Alec, Armand, and Sebastian all desined their versions of their machines on tinker cad. i made mine with a ramp, a door, a pulley, and a seesaw type thing. It was very hard to put the different shapes perfectly. Although it was hard I managed to do it and I was able to finish the ramp and the door part.</p>
    <p>9/5/22-9/16/22 - Last week we were told to design our rube goldburg machine so me and my table partners designed the machine on tinker cad. We eventually decided on my design and this week we started to build it out of cardboard. We are about 25% done and I am proud of the progress we have done. OH and for challenge day this week we made paper boats that are supposed to hold weights and we won with 90 grams on our boat yay...</p>
    <p>9/19/22-9/23/22 - This week we did map testing. Also this week we finished our rube goldburg machine. It doesn't look the same as our tinker cad but it still has the same componenets just made differently. It worked on the 5th try. It didn't work 4 times because the needle wasn't reinforced enough and also there was too much friction on the top of the pulley.</p>

    <p>9/26/22 - 9/30/22 - This week we dissected a laptop. It was very dusty and musty and crusty. The screws were hard to unscrew and my group helped me a lot. My hands were very dirty after and we also did a coloring worksheet. It was very hard to put it back together because I forgot what type of screws went in each hole.</p>
